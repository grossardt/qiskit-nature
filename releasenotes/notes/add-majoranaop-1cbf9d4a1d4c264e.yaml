    Adds a new operator class, :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.MajoranaOp`
    to handle operators that are sums of tensor products of Majorana fermion operators.
    This is needed for the implementation of the Ternary Tree Mapper, but might be useful
    later on for other purposes as well.

    Majorana operators use a string representation with underscore only, e.g. ``'_0 _1'``
    corresponds to :math:`\gamma_0 \gamma_1` where there are twice the number of spin orbitals
    operators satisfying :math:`\{\gamma_i,\gamma_j\} = 2 \delta_{ij}`.

    Methods of :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.MajoranaOp` are the same as for
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.FermionicOp` except for normal ordering, which is
    unnecessary. A Majorana operator can be created from a Fermionic operator using the
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.MajoranaOp.from_fermionic_op`  class method.

    Reference to `to_matrix` method in the documentation of
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.FermionicOp` has been removed as there is no such
    method.
