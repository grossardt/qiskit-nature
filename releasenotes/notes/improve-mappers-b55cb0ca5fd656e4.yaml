features:
  - |
    The class :class:`.second_q.mappers.ModeBasedMapper` has been added to implement mode based
    mapping via a Pauli table (previously part of :class:`.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper`).
upgrade:
  - |
    The mode based mappers :class:`.JordanWignerMapper`, :class:`.BravyiKitaevMapper`,
    :class:`.ParityMapper`, and :class:`.DirectMapper` are now inheriting also from the new
    class :class:`.ModeBasedMapper` to implement the :meth:`.mode_based_mapping` method.
  - |
    :meth:`.pauli_table` is now an instance method of all :class:`.ModeBasedMapper` subclasses
    (previously a class method of :class:`.QubitMapper`)
  - |
    Caching has been removed from the parent classes :class:`.QubitMapper` and
    :class:`.ModeBasedMapper` and is now implemented exclusively for the :meth:`.pauli_table`
    methods in the child classes.
